          <h2>Stand up comedy</h2>
          <p>
            I loved stand up comedy since I was probably like 16 or 17. I used
            to watch indian comics perform on youtube and that gave me a certain
            kick and enthusiasm. I always enjoyed making other people laugh so I
            thought I could do it if I am given the chance. Luckily, I perfomed
            my first stand up when I was 18 and it went quite viral. Since then,
            I enjoy writing scripts and performing standups on different topics
            time and again.

          <h2>Football</h2>
          <p>
            I started playing football when I was about 10 years of age. Since
            then, Football has been one of the dearest things to me throught my
            life. Honestly, I always dreamt of becoming a football player once I
            was big enough. I also watch Football. I support Arsenal Football
            club and I have been supporting the club for about 8 years now. The
            game helps me forget some level of stress.

          <p>
            I have captained my team from school to different tournaments and
            also I along with my team won few of them. I even went to different
            colleges to play football when I was in india. I probably won't stop
            playing this beautiful game ever.

            "On the side, I also love reading books. I generally prefer reading
            novels that have mysterious endings. Khaled Hosseini is one of my
            favorite writers. His writing feels so simple yet very elegant. I
            also watch animes and play computer games. Counter strike and FIFA
            are some of the games I play on regular basis. I am also very much
            interested in Astro Physics and diferent theroies regarding it."

          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>
            Music came quite later on in my life but has stayed with me ever
            since. I was fascinated with how people used to play Guitar. I
            wanted to learn how to play it. It took about a year to understand
            the basics of it and along with playing Guitar, I started singing
            too. Since then, I sing and play the instruement almost everyday, I
            have written songs, composed and published some of them too. One of
            my favorite music Artist is Sia.
